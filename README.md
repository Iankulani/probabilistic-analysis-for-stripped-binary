# probabilistic-analysis-for-stripped-binary
This repository provides a Python-based cybersecurity tool for performing probabilistic analysis on stripped binaries generated from C/C++ source files.
Stripped binaries—those that have been stripped of their symbol information—pose a challenge for reverse engineers and analysts, as they lack valuable information like function names, variable names, 
and debug information. This tool helps by providing essential analysis through entropy calculations and byte frequency distribution, offering insights into the characteristics of stripped binaries.
